 **********	GSShapePallete	**********
 
 The shape palette holds an NSArray (shapes) which contains instances
 of each of the shapes in the GSShape library. The GSShapePalette can be 
 assigned a 'Palette' object in its [init] method, which defines the colors
 of the shapes in the 'shapes' NSArray.
 
 There are several occasions where a different group of shapes needs to be
 drawn, and rather than manage individual GSShapes (individually assigning colors
 etcâ€¦), GSShapePalette allows groups of shapes to be defined and used.
